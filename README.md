## 🌐 Technologies Used

For the development of F1Desktop, a combination of technologies was used to ensure efficient performance and a smooth user experience:

### Frontend: Pure HTML and CSS
The page's design was built using **pure HTML and CSS**, following modern web standards and avoiding the use of elements like `div` and `id` selectors in the CSS. This results in more structured, semantic, and easy-to-maintain code.

### Client-Side and Server-Side Computing
The project incorporates a balanced mix of programming technologies:
* **JavaScript**: Responsible for approximately half of the client-side computational logic.
* **PHP**: Used to manage the other half of the logic, allowing for integration with the server and databases.

### API Integration
Various APIs have been implemented in both **JavaScript** and **PHP** to provide a dynamic and interactive experience:
* 🌦️ **Real-time Meteorology**: Consultation and display of up-to-date weather data.
* 🗺️ **Dynamic and Static Maps**: Graphical representation of circuits and relevant locations.
* 🎠 **Image Carousel**: An interactive gallery with Formula 1 images.
* 🏁 **Up-to-date F1 Data**: Real-time information about the championship.

### MariaDB Database
For data management, especially in the interactive games, **MariaDB** was used, ensuring an efficient structure for storing and retrieving information.

## 🎮 Interactive Games

F1Desktop doesn't just provide information; it also includes **several interactive games** designed to enhance the user experience:

1.  **🃏 F1 Card Memory**: A classic game where the user must find matching pairs of Formula 1-related cards.
2.  **🚦 Reaction Traffic Light**: A reflex test where the user must react to the changing lights of the traffic signal, simulating a race start.
3.  **❓ What Would You Rather?**: A question game where the user chooses between different F1-related options.
4.  **🏎️ 3D F1 Car Viewer**: A **real-time** visualization of a Formula 1 car, allowing users to explore its details through an interactive 3D model.

## 📱 Adaptability and Optimization

One of the fundamental pillars of the project was to ensure a seamless experience on any device. To achieve this, various responsive design techniques were applied, including **media queries** and adaptation strategies for different screen sizes.

F1Desktop has achieved a score of over **90% on Google Lighthouse**, which guarantees efficient performance, reduced loading times, and an optimal user experience.
